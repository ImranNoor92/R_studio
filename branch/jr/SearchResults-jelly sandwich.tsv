IPR008987	Baseplate structural protein Gp9/Gp10	The members of this family are similar to gene products 9 (gp9) and 10 (gp10) of bacteriophage T4. Both proteins are components of the viral baseplate [[cite:PUB00016498]]. Gp9 connects the long tail fibres of the virus to the baseplate and triggers tail contraction after viral attachment to a host cell. The protein is active as a trimer, with each monomer being composed of three domains. The N-terminal domain consists of an extended polypeptide chain and two α helices. The alpha1 helix from each of the three monomers in the trimer interacts with its counterparts to form a coiled-coil structure. The middle domain is a seven-stranded β-sandwich that is thought to be a novel protein fold. The C-terminal domain is thought to be essential for gp9 trimerisation and is organised into an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, which was found to resemble the 'jelly roll' fold found in many viral capsid proteins. The long flexible region between the N-terminal and middle domains may be required for the function of gp9 to transmit signals from the long tail fibres [[cite:PUB00010705]]. Together with gp11, gp10 initiates the assembly of wedges that then go on to associate with a hub to form the viral baseplate [[cite:PUB00016498]]. This entry represents the N-terminal domain of Gp10, that in Gp9 covers the full length.	INTERPRO

HA consists of three different proteins, designated HA70 (also known as HA3), HA33 (HA1), and HA17 (HA2) based on molecular mass [[cite:PUB00091109]]. HA70 consists of three domains (D1-3). The D1 and D2 domains, which adopt similar structures, mediate the trimerization of HA70 with each protomer. The D3 domain, sitting at the tip of the trimer, is composed of two similar jelly-roll-like beta-sandwich structures [[cite:PUB00091178]].

Structurally, the C-JID core is represented by a β-sandwich made up of 8 to 9 β-strands. C-JID matches the so-called post-LRR or C-terminal non-LRR domain detected earlier via MEME and BLAST searches [[cite:PUB00098644], [cite:PUB00100184]]. The domain showed a strong distribution bias towards TIR-NLRs of dicotyledonous plant species despite broader taxonomic distribution of TIR-NLR in plant groups [[cite:PUB00098643], [cite:PUB00098642], [cite:PUB00098644], [cite:PUB00100184]].

Presence of C-JID (or post-LRR) and its importance for the function of Arabidopsis TIR-NLR RPS4 that partners with RRS1 for effector recognition suggest that C-JID has additional functions [[cite:PUB00100183], [cite:PUB00100185], [cite:PUB00100186]].

The crystal structure of the Trp RNA-binding attenuation protein of Bacillus subtilis (mtrB, [swissprot:P19466]) has been solved [[cite:PUB00004208]]. TRAP forms an oligomeric ring consisting of 11 single-domain subunits, where each subunit adopts a double-stranded β-helix structure with the appearance of a β-sandwich of distinct architecture and jelly-roll fold. The 11 subunits are stabilised by 11 inter-subunit strands, forming a β-wheel with a large central hole. TRAP is activated by binding to tryptophan in clefts between adjacent β-strands, which induces conformational changes in the protein. Activated TRAP binds an mRNA target sequence consisting of 11 (G/U)AG repeats, separated by 2-3 spacer nucleotides. The spacer nucleotides do not make direct contact with the TRAP protein, but they do influence the conformation of the RNA, which might influence the specificity of TRAP [[cite:PUB00022801]].

IPR036262	Resistin-like superfamily	This superfamily consists of several mammalian resistin proteins. Resistin is a 12.5kDa cysteine-rich secreted polypeptide first reported from rodent adipocytes. It belongs to a multigene family termed RELMs or FIZZ proteins. Plasma resistin levels are significantly increased in both genetically susceptible and high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Immunoneutralisation of resistin improves hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, while administration of recombinant resistin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin action in normal mice. It has been demonstrated that increases in circulating resistin levels markedly stimulate glucose production in the presence of fixed physiological insulin levels, whereas insulin suppressed resistin expression.

IPR000386	Haemagglutinin, influenzavirus B	"Haemagglutinin (HA) is one of two main surface fusion glycoproteins embedded in the envelope of influenza viruses, the other being neuraminidase (NA). There are sixteen known HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9), which together are used to classify influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). The antigenic variations in HA and NA enable the virus to evade host antibodies made to previous influenza strains, accounting for recurrent influenza epidemics [[cite:PUB00033165]]. The HA glycoprotein is present in the viral membrane as a single polypeptide (HA0), which must be cleaved by the host's trypsin-like proteases to produce two peptides (HA1 and HA2) in order for the virus to be infectious. Once HA0 is cleaved, the newly exposed N-terminal of the HA2 peptide then acts to fuse the viral envelope to the cellular membrane of the host cell, which allows the viral negative-stranded RNA to infect the host cell. The type of host protease can influence the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.

The haemagglutinin glycoprotein is a trimer containing three structurally distinct regions: a globular head consisting of anti-parallel β-sheets that form a β-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold (contains the receptor binding site and the HA1/HA2 cleavage site); a triple-stranded, coiled-coil, α-helical stalk; and a globular foot composed of anti-parallel β-sheets [[cite:PUB00033162], [cite:PUB00033164]]. Each monomer consists of an intact HA0 polypeptide with the HA1 and HA2 regions linked by disulphide bonds.

PS51172	CBM3 (carbohydrate binding type-3) domain profile	"Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) have been classified into more than 40
families according to sequence homology [E1]. Several cellulolytic enzymes
share a conserved region of about 150 amino acid residues, the CBM3 domain
[[cite:PUB00001730]]. It has been classified in three different subtypes, termed family IIIa,
IIIb and IIIc. The family IIIa (scaffoldin) and IIIb (mainly free enzymes) are
closely similar in their primary structures and both types bind strongly to
crystalline cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296]][[cite:PUB00025133]]. Members of the family IIIc, fails to bind
crystalline cellulose, but serves in a 'helper' capacity by feeding a single
incoming cellulose chain into the active site of the neighbouring catalytic
module pending hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00033741]][[cite:PUB00033742]].

The CBM3 domain is mainly found C-terminal to the catalytic domain, which
correspond to a wide range of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases like family 9, family 5 and family 10.

The crystal structure of CBM3 has been solved [[cite:PUB00001296]]. It
consists of nine beta-strands which form a compact domain that has an overall
prismatic shape. It is arranged in two antiparallel beta-sheets that stack
face-to-face to form a beta sandwich with jelly roll topology. Two defined
surfaces, located on opposite sides of the molecule, contain conserved polar
and aromatic residues which are probably involved in the binding of the CBM to
cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296]][[cite:PUB00025133]]. The first one forms a planar strip whereas the second one

The family IIIa (scaffoldin) and IIIb (mainly free enzymes) are closely similar in their primary structures and both types bind strongly to crystalline cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296], [cite:PUB00025133]]. Members of the family IIIc, fail to bind crystalline cellulose, but serve in a 'helper' capacity by feeding a single incoming cellulose chain into the active site of the neighbouring catalytic module pending hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00033741], [cite:PUB00033742]].

The CBM3 domain is mainly found C-terminal to the catalytic domain, which correspond to a wide range of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases like family 9, family 5 and family 10.

The crystal structure of CBM3 has been solved [[cite:PUB00001296]]. It consists of nine β-strands which form a compact domain that has an overall prismatic shape. It is arranged in two antiparallel β-sheets that stack face-to-face to form a β sandwich with jelly roll topology. Two defined surfaces, located on opposite sides of the molecule, contain conserved polar and aromatic residues which are probably involved in the binding of the CBM to cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296], [cite:PUB00025133]]. The first one forms a planar strip whereas the second one forms a shallow groove.

Some proteins known to contain a CBM3 domain are listed below:



Clostridial cellulosomal scaffolding proteins cipA, cipC and cbpA. They promote the binding of cellulose to the catalytic domains of the cellulolytic enzymes.
Bacterial cellulases A, B, F, G, I, N, Y, Z (Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, [ec:3.2.1.4]).

IPR014831	Haemagglutinin stalk, influenza C	"Haemagglutinin (HA) is one of two main surface fusion glycoproteins embedded in the envelope of influenza viruses, the other being neuraminidase (NA). There are sixteen known HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9), which together are used to classify influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). The antigenic variations in HA and NA enable the virus to evade host antibodies made to previous influenza strains, accounting for recurrent influenza epidemics [[cite:PUB00033165]]. The HA glycoprotein is present in the viral membrane as a single polypeptide (HA0), which must be cleaved by the host's trypsin-like proteases to produce two peptides (HA1 and HA2) in order for the virus to be infectious. Once HA0 is cleaved, the newly exposed N-terminal of the HA2 peptide then acts to fuse the viral envelope to the cellular membrane of the host cell, which allows the viral negative-stranded RNA to infect the host cell. The type of host protease can influence the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.

The haemagglutinin glycoprotein is a trimer containing three structurally distinct regions: a globular head consisting of anti-parallel β-sheets that form a β-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold (contains the receptor binding site and the HA1/HA2 cleavage site); a triple-stranded, coiled-coil, α-helical stalk; and a globular foot composed of anti-parallel β-sheets [[cite:PUB00033162], [cite:PUB00033164]]. Each monomer consists of an intact HA0 polypeptide with the HA1 and HA2 regions linked by disulphide bonds. The N terminus of HA1 provides the central strand in the 5-stranded globular foot, while the rest of the HA1 chain makes its way to the 8-stranded globular head.  HA2 provides two α helices, which form part of the triple-stranded coiled-coil that stabilises the trimer, its C terminus providing the remaining strands of the 5-stranded globular foot. This entry represents the stalk segment of haemagglutinin in influenza C virus.  It forms a coiled coil structure [[cite:PUB00010667]]."	INTERPRO

IPR000859	CUB domain	"The CUB domain (for complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) is a structural motif of approximately 110 residues found almost exclusively in extracellular and plasma membrane-associated proteins, many of which are developmentally regulated [[cite:PUB00003306], [cite:PUB00001610]]. These proteins are involved in a diverse range of functions, including complement activation, developmental patterning, tissue repair, axon guidance and angiogenesis, cell signalling, fertilisation, haemostasis, inflammation, neurotransmission, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and tumour suppression [[cite:PUB00035660]]. Many CUB-containing proteins are peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase families M12A (astacin) and S1A (chymotrypsin). Proteins containing a CUB domain include:



Mammalian complement subcomponents C1s/C1r, which form the calcium-dependent complex C1, the first component of the classical pathway of the complement system.

Cricetidae sp. (Hamster) serine protease Casp, which degrades type I and IV collagen and fibronectin in the presence of calcium.

Mammalian complement-activating component of Ra-reactive factor (RARF), a protease that cleaves the C4 component of complement.

Vertebrate enteropeptidase ([ec:3.4.21.9]), a type II membrane protein of the intestinal brush border, which activates trypsinogen.

Vertebrate bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP-1), a protein which induces cartilage and bone formation and expresses metalloendopeptidase activity.

Sea urchin blastula proteins BP10 and SpAN.

Several of the above proteins consist of a catalytic domain together with several CUB domains interspersed by calcium-binding EGF domains. Some CUB domains appear to be involved in oligomerisation and/or recognition of substrates and binding partners. For example, in the complement proteases, the CUB domains mediate dimerisation and binding to collagen-like regions of target proteins (e.g. C1q for C1r/C1s). The structure of CUB domains consists of a β-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold. Almost all CUB domains contain four conserved cysteines that probably form two disulphide bridges (C1-C2, C3-C4). The CUB1 domains of C1s and Map19 have calcium-binding sites [[cite:PUB00035659]]."	INTERPRO
