IPR027411	Baseplate structural protein Gp9/Gp10 middle domain superfamily	This superfamily represents the middle domain found in baseplate structural protein Gp9 and Gp10 of bacteriophage T4. The Bacteriophage T4 is a double-stranded, structurally complex virus that infects Escherichia coli.  Gene product 9 (Gp9) connects the long tail fibres to the baseplate, and triggers baseplate reorganisation and tail contraction after virus attachment to the host cell.  The Gp9 protein forms a homotrimer, with each monomer having three domains:  the N-terminal α-helical domain forms a triple coiled coil, the middle domain is a mixed, seven-stranded β sandwich with a unique fold, and the C-terminal domain is a eight-stranded β-sandwich with similarity to jellyroll viral capsid protein structures [[cite:PUB00010705]].  The flexible loops that occur between domains may enable the conformational changes necessary during infection. Together with gp11, gp10 initiates the assembly of wedges that then go on to associate with a hub to form the viral baseplate [[cite:PUB00016498]].	INTERPRO

The prodomain adopts a similar fold to the prodomains of related subtilisin-like proteases with the C-terminal region extending deep into the catalytic cleft. However, unlike the majority of subtilisin-like proteases, the prodomain stays bound to the subtilase domain via a network of interactions that result in tighter prodomain binding relative to other subtilases.

PS00555	Plant viruses icosahedral capsid proteins S region signature	"The capsid protein of plant icosahedral positive strand RNA viruses generally
consists of four distinct domains: an N-terminal positively charged 'R' domain
involved in the interaction with RNA, a connecting arm 'a', a central domain
'S' forming the virion shell, and a C-terminal projecting 'P' domain. Some of
the viruses lack either the R or P domains.

It has been shown [[cite:PUB00003137]] that the S domain of the capsid protein of a number of
plant viruses are evolutionary related, namely:

 - Carmoviruses: carnation mottle  virus (CarMV),  melon  necrotic  spot virus
   (MNSV), and turnip crinkle virus (TCV).
 - Dianthoviruses: red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV).

   mosaic virus (SBMV).
 - Tombusviruses: artichoke mottled  crinkle virus (AMCV),  cucumber  necrosis
   virus (CNV), cymbidium ringspot virus (CyRSV), and tomato bushy stunt virus
   (TBSV).
 - Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV).

The S domain of these viruses contains from 158 to 166 amino acids and is
composed of eight beta-strand anti-parallel twisted sheets in what is known as
a 'jellyroll' conformation. The signature pattern for this domain starts at

The vp7 and vp6 capsid proteins each consist of two domains, one a β sandwich, and the other an α helical bundle.  The β sandwich domain described here is structurally very similar in vp6 and vp7, and may be involved in the attachment of the virus to the cell.  In influenza A and B viruses, the haemagglutinin membrane glycoprotein serves to recognise the cell surface receptor sialic acid, and this domain forms the head region.  In influenza C virus, a single multifunctional glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein, possesses a haemagglutinin domain, which recognises the cell surface receptor 9-O-acetylsialic acid, and bears strong structural resemblance to the haemagglutinin protein of influenza A and B viruses, as well as to the vp6 and vp7 capsid proteins.

   ortholog of human neuronal pentraxin II (gene NPTX2) [[cite:PUB00001965]].
 - Rat neuronal pentraxin I [[cite:PUB00004314]].

The pentraxin domain has also been found in multidomain proteins, such as:

 - Mammalian  polydom,  an  extracellular protein which includes an N-terminal
   von Willebrand  factor  A  domain, hyalin repeats (HYRs),    epidermal   growth   factor   repeats   (EGFs), sushi  domains,  and  a  single pentraxin
   domain.
 - Vertebrate  adhesion  G-protein-coupled  receptors  (GPRs),  in  particular
   GPR144, GPR112, and GPR126.

The function of these proteins has not been defined yet, nor has the role of
the pentraxin domain in multidomain proteins.

The pentraxin domain consists of two anti-parallel beta-sheets in the form of
a flattened beta-barrel with a jellyroll topology [[cite:PUB00109115]][[cite:PUB00021698]].

The pentraxin domain is related to the laminin G (LamG) and
thrombospondin N-terminal (TspN) domains [[cite:PUB00003384]].

The sequences of the different members of this family are quite conserved. As
a signature, we selected a six residue pattern which includes a cysteine
known to be involved in a disulfide bridge in CRPs and SAP. We have also
developed a profile that covers the entire pentraxin domain."	PROSITE
IPR005084	Carbohydrate binding module family 6	"This entry represents [cazy:CBM6] which was previously known as cellulose-binding domain family VI (CBD VI).  CBM6 bind to amorphous cellulose, xylan, mixed beta-(1,3)(1,4)glucan and beta-1,3-glucan [[cite:PUB00032219], [cite:PUB00033743], [cite:PUB00031940]].

CBM6 adopts a classic lectin-like β-jelly roll fold, predominantly consisting of five antiparallel β-strands on one face and four antiparallel β-strands on the other face. It contains two potential ligand binding sites, named respectively cleft A and B. These clefts include aromatic residues which are probably involved in the substrate binding. The cleft B is located on the concave surface of one β-sheet, and the cleft A on one edge of the protein between the loop that connects the inner and outer β-sheets of the jellyroll fold [[cite:PUB00033744]]. The multiple binding clefts confer the extensive range of specificities displayed by the domain [[cite:PUB00032219], [cite:PUB00033743], [cite:PUB00031940]]. A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) is defined as a contiguous amino acid sequence within a carbohydrate-active enzyme with a discreet fold having carbohydrate-binding activity. A few exceptions are CBMs in cellulosomal scaffolding proteins and rare instances of independent putative CBMs. The requirement of CBMs existing as modules within larger enzymes sets this class of carbohydrate-binding protein apart from other non-catalytic sugar binding proteins such as lectins and sugar transport proteins.



CBMs were previously classified as cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) based on the initial discovery of several modules that bound cellulose [[cite:PUB00054922], [cite:PUB00054923]]. However, additional modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes are continually being found that bind carbohydrates other than cellulose yet otherwise meet the CBM criteria, hence the need to reclassify these polypeptides using more inclusive terminology.



Previous classification of cellulose-binding domains were based on amino acid similarity. Groupings of CBDs were called ""Types"" and numbered with roman numerals (e.g. Type I or Type II CBDs). In keeping with the glycoside hydrolase classification, these groupings are now called families and numbered with Arabic numerals. Families 1 to 13 are the same as Types I to XIII. For a detailed review on the structure and binding modes of CBMs see [[cite:PUB00054924]]."	INTERPRO
IPR002960	Lymphotoxin-alpha	"Cytokines can be grouped into a family on the basis of sequence, functional and structural similarities [[cite:PUB00002042], [cite:PUB00004130], [cite:PUB00015257]]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (also known as TNF-alpha or cachectin) is a monocyte-derived cytotoxin that has been implicated in tumour regression, septic shock and cachexia [[cite:PUB00006091], [cite:PUB00006095]]. The protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine [[cite:PUB00006101]]. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00006098]]. Both the mature protein and a partially-processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide [[cite:PUB00006098]].

There are a number of different families of TNF, but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that are recognised by their specific receptors. Lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha or TNF-beta) and lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta) are related cytokines produced by lymphocytes. The proteins are cytotoxic for a wide range of tumour cells in vitro and in vivo.

The structure of TNF-beta has been determined to 1.9 A using X-ray crystallography and phase determination via molecular replacement using TNF-alpha. Like TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin folds to form a 'jellyroll' β-sheet sandwich. Three-fold related LT subunits form a trimer primarily stabilised by hydrophobic interactions. A cluster of 6 basic residues around the 3-fold axis is thought to account for the acid lability of the trimer. Although the structural cores of TNF-alpha and LT are similar, insertions and deletions relative to TNF-alpha occur in loops at the 'top' of the LT trimer, significantly altering the local structure. The sites of two mutations (Asp-50 and Tyr-108) that abolish the cytotoxicity of LT are contained within poorly-ordered loops that flank the cleft between neighbouring subunits at the base of the molecule, suggesting that the receptor recognises an intersubunit binding site [[cite:PUB00005996]]."

PS51828	Pentraxin (PTX) domain profile	"Pentraxins (earlier also termed pentaxins), named for their homopentameric
quaternary structure, are a superfamily of multifunctional conserved proteins
that are characterized by a cyclic multimeric structure and by the presence in
their carboxyl-terminal of an ~200 aa-long conserved domain, called pentraxin
(PTX) domain. In addition, all the members of this family share an 8 aa-long
conserved sequence (HxCxS/TWxS, in which x is any amino acid) in the pentraxin
domain, called pentraxin signature. Some pentraxins, together with collectins
and ficolins, constitute the humoral arm of innate immunity and behave as
functional ancestors of Abs by mediating agglutination, complement activation,
and opsonisation [[cite:PUB00000009]][[cite:PUB00001068]][[cite:PUB00109114]]. They are divided into short:

 - C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein which, in  mammals, is expressed during
   acute phase response to tissue injury or inflammation. CRP displays several
   functions  associated  with   host  defense:  it  promotes   agglutination,
   bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis  and complement  fixation through
   its calcium-dependent binding  to phosphorylcholine.   CRPs  have also been
   sequenced in an invertebrate, the Atlantic horseshoe crab, where they are a
   normal constituent of the hemolymph.
 - Serum Amyloid P-component (SAP), a precursor of amyloid  component P  which
   is found in basement membrane and is associated with amyloid deposits.
 - Hamster  female  protein  (FP),  a  plasma  protein  whose concentration is
   altered by sex steroids and stimuli that elicit an acute phase response.

PS00371	PTS EIIA domains phosphorylation site signature 1	"The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) [[cite:PUB00003612]][[cite:PUB00000073]]
is a major carbohydrate transport system in bacteria. The PTS catalyzes the
phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitant with their
translocation across the cell membrane. The general mechanism of the PTS is
the following: a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is
transferred to enzyme I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl
carrier protein (HPr). Phospho-HPr then transfers the
phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three
structurally distinct domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC), [[cite:PUB00002162]] which can either be
fused together in a single polypeptide chain or exist as two or three
interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

The first domain (IIA) , carries the first permease-specific phosphorylation
site, an histidine which is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr. The second domain
(IIB) is phosphorylated by phospho-IIA on a cysteinyl or
histidyl residue, depending on the sugar transported. Finally, the phosphoryl
group is transferred from the IIB domain to the sugar substrate concomitantly
with the sugar uptake processed by the IIC domain. The IIC
domain forms the translocation channel and at the specific substrate-binding
site. An additional transmembrane domain IID, homologous to
IIC, can be found in some PTSs, e.g. for mannose [[cite:PUB00003612]][[cite:PUB00002162]][[cite:PUB00017027]][[cite:PUB00017028]][[cite:PUB00017925]].

(EC 2.7.1.-) can be divided in five groups [[cite:PUB00017926]][[cite:PUB00017927]][[cite:PUB00006380]].

 - The PTS EIIA type 1 domain, which is found in the Glucose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  100  amino  acids. It forms an antiparallel
   beta-barrel   structure  that  incorporates  'Greek  key'  and  'jellyroll'
   topological  motifs.  The  phosphorylation site (His) is
   located  in  the  middle  of the domain, at the C-terminus of a beta-strand
   [[cite:PUB00017926]].

 - The  PTS EIIA type 2  domain, which is  found in the Mannitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length  of  about  142  amino  acids.  It  consists of an
   alternating  beta/alpha  arrangement  of  five-stranded beta-sheet and five
   alpha-helices,  where  the  two last alpha helices forms an helical hairpin.  The  phosphorylation  site  (His)  is  located  at  the
   N-terminus of the domain, at the topological switch-point of the structure,
   close to the subunit interface [[cite:PUB00017927]].

 - The PTS EIIA type 3 domain, which is found in the Lactose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  100  amino  acids.  It is composed of three
   alpha-helices. The phosphorylation site (His) is located
   at the C-terminus of the domain in the third alpha helix [[cite:PUB00006380]].

 - The PTS EIIA type 4 domain, which is found in the Mannose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  130  amino  acids.  It consists of a single
   five-stranded  mixed  beta  sheet,  flanked  by  helices on both sides.  The  phosphorylation  site (His) is located at the end of the
   third  beta  strand,  in  a shallow crevice lined with hydrophobic residues
   [10].

 - The  PTS EIIA type 5  domain, which is found  in the Sorbitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length of about 110 amino acids. The phosphorylation site
   (His) is located at the N-terminus of the domain.

EIIA-like domains similar to type 1 to 4 can be found in other kind of
proteins, which are mainly transcriptional regulators [[cite:PUB00017028]]. In these cases, the
EIIA-like domain is found in association with other domains like the Sigma-54
interaction domain, the DeoR-type HTH domain, or the PTS regulation domain (transcriptional
antiterminator). It may possess a regulatory function, through its
phosphorylation activity, or act as a simple phosphoryl donor. Some proteins

is a major carbohydrate transport system in bacteria. The PTS catalyzes the
phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitant with their
translocation across the cell membrane. The general mechanism of the PTS is
the following: a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is
transferred to enzyme I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl
carrier protein (HPr). Phospho-HPr then transfers the
phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three
structurally distinct domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC), [[cite:PUB00002162]] which can either be
fused together in a single polypeptide chain or exist as two or three
interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

The first domain (IIA) , carries the first permease-specific phosphorylation
site, an histidine which is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr. The second domain
(IIB) is phosphorylated by phospho-IIA on a cysteinyl or
histidyl residue, depending on the sugar transported. Finally, the phosphoryl
group is transferred from the IIB domain to the sugar substrate concomitantly
with the sugar uptake processed by the IIC domain. The IIC
domain forms the translocation channel and at the specific substrate-binding
site. An additional transmembrane domain IID, homologous to
IIC, can be found in some PTSs, e.g. for mannose [[cite:PUB00003612]][[cite:PUB00002162]][[cite:PUB00017027]][[cite:PUB00017028]][[cite:PUB00017925]].

According to structural and sequence analyses, the PTS EIIA domain
(EC 2.7.1.-) can be divided in five groups [[cite:PUB00017926]][[cite:PUB00017927]][[cite:PUB00006380]].

 - The PTS EIIA type 1 domain, which is found in the Glucose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  100  amino  acids. It forms an antiparallel
   beta-barrel   structure  that  incorporates  'Greek  key'  and  'jellyroll'
   topological  motifs.  The  phosphorylation site (His) is
   located  in  the  middle  of the domain, at the C-terminus of a beta-strand
   [[cite:PUB00017926]].

 - The  PTS EIIA type 2  domain, which is  found in the Mannitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length  of  about  142  amino  acids.  It  consists of an
   alternating  beta/alpha  arrangement  of  five-stranded beta-sheet and five
   alpha-helices,  where  the  two last alpha helices forms an helical hairpin.  The  phosphorylation  site  (His)  is  located  at  the
   N-terminus of the domain, at the topological switch-point of the structure,
   close to the subunit interface [[cite:PUB00017927]].

 - The PTS EIIA type 3 domain, which is found in the Lactose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  100  amino  acids.  It is composed of three
   alpha-helices. The phosphorylation site (His) is located
   at the C-terminus of the domain in the third alpha helix [[cite:PUB00006380]].

 - The PTS EIIA type 4 domain, which is found in the Mannose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  130  amino  acids.  It consists of a single
   five-stranded  mixed  beta  sheet,  flanked  by  helices on both sides.  The  phosphorylation  site (His) is located at the end of the
   third  beta  strand,  in  a shallow crevice lined with hydrophobic residues
   [10].

 - The  PTS EIIA type 5  domain, which is found  in the Sorbitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length of about 110 amino acids. The phosphorylation site
   (His) is located at the N-terminus of the domain.

EIIA-like domains similar to type 1 to 4 can be found in other kind of
proteins, which are mainly transcriptional regulators [[cite:PUB00017028]]. In these cases, the
EIIA-like domain is found in association with other domains like the Sigma-54
interaction domain, the DeoR-type HTH domain, or the PTS regulation domain (transcriptional
antiterminator). It may possess a regulatory function, through its
phosphorylation activity, or act as a simple phosphoryl donor. Some proteins
known to contains a EIIA-like domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial transcriptional regulatory proteins levR, nrtC, bglG.
 - Bacterial lactose permease lacS, a non-PTS transport system.
 - Bacterial PTS-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase, phosphotransferase subunit
   dhaM.

IIA domains. We also developed five profiles that cover the entire PTS EIIA
