This entry represents the jelly-roll domain [[cite:PUB00153805]].","PFAM"
"PF22794","ZPR1 jelly-roll domain","This entry represents the jelly-roll domain found in ZPR1 family. The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It is indeed known to be an essential protein in yeast. In quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens, ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00020594],[cite:PUB00020595],[cite:PUB00017397]]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes [[cite:PUB00020594]]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation [[cite:PUB00020594]], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression [[cite:PUB00020595]]. ZPR1 binds preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00045181]]. The alignment for the ZPR1 family shows a duplicated set composed of a zinc-ribbon domain followed by a jelly- roll domain (this entry). This family also includes several hypothetical archaeal proteins (from both Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota). This similarity between ZPR1 and archaeal proteins was not previously noted.","PFAM"
"PF17644","Jelly-roll domain of 30K viral movement proteins","This entry represents the core domain found in viral movement proteins (MP) of the 30K type. The core domain is conserved among MPs of 30K sharing the same predicted secondary structure which consists of 1 alpha-helix and 7 predicted beta-strands. The only sequence feature common to all 30K MPs is a short region between beta-strands 1 and 2, which contains several conserved hydrophobic positions, and a nearly-invariant aspartate which constitutes the sequence signature of the superfamily. This signature aspartate has a conserved role in essential for viral cell-to-cell movement [[cite:PUB00091032]].

Both proteins are components of the viral baseplate [[cite:PUB00016498]]. Gp9 (Swiss:P10927) connects the long tail fibres of the virus to the baseplate and triggers tail contraction after viral attachment to a host cell. The protein is active as a trimer, with each monomer being composed of three domains.  The N-terminal domain consists of an extended polypeptide chain and two alpha helices. The alpha1 helix from each of the three monomers in the trimer interacts with its counterparts to form a coiled-coil structure. The middle domain is a seven-stranded beta-sandwich that is thought to be a novel protein fold. The C-terminal domain is thought to be essential for gp9 trimerisation and is organised into an eight- stranded antiparallel beta-barrel, which was found to resemble the 'jelly roll' fold found in many viral capsid proteins. The long flexible region between the N-terminal and middle domains may be required for the function of gp9 to transmit signals from the long tail fibres [[cite:PUB00010705]].

"PF21881","A223 penton protein second domain","This Pfam entry represents the Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) penton protein second jelly roll domain. STIV is a virus that infects the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus and was isolated in acidic hot springs. The virus has a unique architecture based on a pseudo T = 31d capsid symmetry with each icosahedral asymmetric unit consisting of 15 copies of the coat subunit (B345), one copy of the A223 penton base protein, one copy of the C381 turret protein, and one copy of the A55 membrane protein. The pentameric penton base protein is a crucial component of the virus as it forms the vertices of the capsid shell and decorates the penton base structure forming the first floor of the turret. The penton protein contains three different layers, with the N termini forming a 10-stranded beta-pore, the middle layer comprising a canonical viral jelly-roll forming a pentameric ring, and the C-terminal forming a second pentameric ring of jelly-rolls. The virus shares the same coat subunit and penton base protein folds as some eukaryotic and bacterial viruses, suggesting that they derive from a common ancestor predating the divergence of the three kingdoms of life. The conservation of the A223 penton base jelly-roll fold, as well as the B345 double jelly-roll fold, strongly suggests an evolutionary connection for these protein modules among phages, archaeal viruses, and eukaryotic viruses.","PFAM"

"PF18448","Carbohydrate binding domain","Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZYmes) that target recalcitrant polysaccharides are modular enzymes containing noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that direct enzymes to their cognate substrate, thus potentiating catalysis. The structure of Bacillus halodurans endo-beta-1,4-glucanase B (Cel5B) reveals that CBM46 is tightly associated with the catalytic module and, dependent on the glucan presented to the enzyme, can contribute directly to substrate binding or play a targeting role in directing the enzyme to regions of the plant cell wall rich in the polysaccharide hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The CBM46 domain displays a classic beta-sandwich jelly roll fold. Against beta-1,3-1,4-glucans CBM46 domain participates in productive substrate binding and thus plays a direct role in the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00138366]].","PFAM"

It regulates microtubule function in neurons and neuronal migration. It binds to the extracellular domains of lipoprotein receptors VLDLR and LRP8/APOER2 which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1 and modulation of TAU phosphorylation. Reelin consists of a signal sequence, an F-spondin-like region and nine sequentially concatenated repeat units. Each complete reelin repeat contains a central epidermal growth factor (EGF) module flanked by two subrepeats of 150-190 amino acids (subrepeats A and B) [1-3]. This entry represents subrepeat B (also referred to R3B) which adopts a beta jelly-roll fold similar to bacterial xylanase. They contain the signature Asp-box motif [1-3].","PFAM"
"PF20160","C-JID domain","C-terminal jelly roll/Ig-like domain (C-JID) was defined in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of plant intracellular immune receptors containing Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR, PF01582), nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC, PF00931) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains (TIR-NLRs) [[cite:PUB00098643],[cite:PUB00098642]]. Structurally, the C-JID core is represented by a beta-sandwich made up of 8 to 9 beta-strands. C-JID matches the so-called post-LRR or C-terminal non-LRR domain detected earlier via MEME and BLAST searches [[cite:PUB00098644],[cite:PUB00100184]]. The domain showed a strong distribution bias towards TIR-NLRs of dicotyledonous plant species despite broader taxonomic distribution of TIR-NLR in plant groups [1-7]. Structure-function analyses of cryoEM structures suggest that C-JID domains play a role in substrate recognition, such as binding to effector proteins from pathogens, and thus are involved in the initiation of signaling by TIR-NLR receptors [[cite:PUB00098643],[cite:PUB00098642]]. Presence of C-JID (or post-LRR) and its importance for the function of Arabidopsis TIR-NLR RPS4 that partners with RRS1 for effector recognition suggest that C-JID has additional functions [4-6].","PFAM"
"PF17999","Pullulanase N1-terminal domain","This is the N-terminal domain found in debranching enzyme such as Pullulanase (PulA)from Anoxybacillus sp. LM18-11. The PulA structure comprises four domains (N1, N2, A, and C). This is the N1 domain which has been identified as a carbohydrate-binding motif. Two maltotriose or maltotetraose molecules were found between the N1 domain and a loop of the A domain in the PulA-maltotriose or PulA-maltotetraose structures. These carbohydrates are bound in a parallel binding mode close to each other and form hydrogen bonds.  The sugar moieties bound to the N1 domain are not immediately adjacent to the active site, but the enzyme might use N1 binding to attract and grab the substrate. Functional analysis indicate that N1 is important for catalytic activity and thermostability in addition to assisting substrate binding. The structure of the N1 domain reveals a classic distorted beta-jelly roll fold consisting of two anti-parallel beta-sheets, forming a concave and a convex surface. On the concave side of N1 domain there is a cleft to accommodate two molecules of maltotriose or maltotetraose [[cite:PUB00091225]].","PFAM"
"PF17993","Haemagglutinin 70 C-terminal domain","This is the C-terminal domain found in hemagglutinin component such as HA70 found in Clostridium botulinum. HA is a component of the large botulinum neurotoxin complex and is critical for its oral toxicity. HA plays multiple roles in toxin penetration in the gastrointestinal tract, including protection from the digestive environment, binding to the intestinal mucosal surface, and disruption of the epithelial barrier [[cite:PUB00091177]]. HA consists of three different proteins, designated HA70 (also known as HA3), HA33 (HA1), and HA17 (HA2) based on molecular mass [[cite:PUB00091109]]. HA70 consists of three domains (D1-3). The D1 and D2 domains, which adopt similar structures, mediate the trimerization of HA70 with each protomer. The D3 domain, sitting at the tip of the trimer, is composed of two similar jelly-roll-like beta-sandwich structures [[cite:PUB00091178]]. Furthermore, crystal structures of HA70 in a complex with alpha2,3- or alpha2,6-SiaLac (alpha2,6-sialyllactose), show that alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-SiaLac bound to the same region in the D3 domain of HA70.

"PF03367","ZPR1 zinc-finger domain","This entry represents the zinc-ribbon domain found in ZPR1 family. The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It is indeed known to be an essential protein in yeast. In quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens, ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00020594],[cite:PUB00020595],[cite:PUB00017397]]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes [[cite:PUB00020594]]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation [[cite:PUB00020594]], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression [[cite:PUB00020595]]. ZPR1 binds preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00045181]]. The alignment for the ZPR1 family shows a duplicated set composed of a zinc-ribbon domain (this entry) followed by a jelly-roll domain. This family also includes several hypothetical archaeal proteins (from both Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota). This similarity between ZPR1 and archaeal proteins was not previously noted.","PFAM"

"PF18425","Csp protease B prodomain","Csp proteases (Csps) and the subtilase protease family Subtilases are serine proteases that contain a catalytic triad in the order of Asp, His and Ser. Structure analysis reveals that Csps are subtilisin-like proteases with two distinctive functional features: a central jellyroll domain and a retained prodomain. The prodomain adopts a similar fold to the prodomains of related subtilisin-like proteases with the C-terminal region extending deep into the catalytic cleft. However, unlike the majority of subtilisin-like proteases, the prodomain stays bound to the subtilase domain via a network of interactions that result in tighter prodomain binding relative to other subtilases. Finally the prodomain acts as both an intramolecular chaperone and an inhibitor of CspB protease activity [[cite:PUB00091545]].","PFAM"

They are a novel class of Gram-positive pili, consisting in single domain subunits with a jellyroll topology comprised by two juxtaposed beta-sheets. This domain represents the S-Ena core. Disulfide bonding through the N-terminal connector peptide that precedes this domain stabilizes longitudinally the fibres, bridging the helical turns. This results in flexible pili, highly resistant to environmental harsh such as heat, drought, and chemical damage [[cite:PUB00098173]].","PFAM"
