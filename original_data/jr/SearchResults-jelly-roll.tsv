INTERPRO
PF22794	ZPR1 jelly-roll domain	This entry represents the jelly-roll domain found in ZPR1 family. The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It is indeed known to be an essential protein in yeast. In quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens, ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00020594],[cite:PUB00020595],[cite:PUB00017397]]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes [[cite:PUB00020594]]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation [[cite:PUB00020594]], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression [[cite:PUB00020595]]. ZPR1 binds preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00045181]]. The alignment for the ZPR1 family shows a duplicated set composed of a zinc-ribbon domain followed by a jelly- roll domain (this entry). This family also includes several hypothetical archaeal proteins (from both Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota). This similarity between ZPR1 and archaeal proteins was not previously noted.	PFAM

IPR056180	ZPR1, jelly-roll domain	This entry represents the jelly-roll domain found in ZPR1 family. This entry consists of zinc finger protein ZPR1 and ZPR1-like proteins. The function of ZPR1 from archaea and eukaryotes is not yet clear. However, Zpr1 from yeast acts as a protein folding chaperone for elongation factor 1-alpha [[cite:PUB00103908]]. ZPR1 is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and its subcellular distribution changes during proliferation [[cite:PUB00035839]]. ZPR1 binds to the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [[cite:PUB00017397]] and is a component of downstream signalling of both EGFR and FGFR signalling [[cite:PUB00090578]]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes, an interaction that is essential for normal cellular proliferation [[cite:PUB00020594]]. It has been associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes [[cite:PUB00090579]] and is downregulated in patients with spinal muscular atrophy [[cite:PUB00090579]]. ZPR1 interacts with complexes formed by SMN [[cite:PUB00035839]], and may act as a modifier that affects the severity of SMA.	INTERPRO

The only sequence feature common to all 30K MPs is a short region between beta-strands 1 and 2, which contains several conserved hydrophobic positions, and a nearly-invariant aspartate which constitutes the sequence signature of the superfamily. This signature aspartate has a conserved role in essential for viral cell-to-cell movement [[cite:PUB00091032]].

PF21881	A223 penton protein second domain	This Pfam entry represents the Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) penton protein second jelly roll domain. STIV is a virus that infects the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus and was isolated in acidic hot springs. The virus has a unique architecture based on a pseudo T = 31d capsid symmetry with each icosahedral asymmetric unit consisting of 15 copies of the coat subunit (B345), one copy of the A223 penton base protein, one copy of the C381 turret protein, and one copy of the A55 membrane protein. The pentameric penton base protein is a crucial component of the virus as it forms the vertices of the capsid shell and decorates the penton base structure forming the first floor of the turret. The penton protein contains three different layers, with the N termini forming a 10-stranded beta-pore, the middle layer comprising a canonical viral jelly-roll forming a pentameric ring, and the C-terminal forming a second pentameric ring of jelly-rolls. The virus shares the same coat subunit and penton base protein folds as some eukaryotic and bacterial viruses, suggesting that they derive from a common ancestor predating the divergence of the three kingdoms of life. The conservation of the A223 penton base jelly-roll fold, as well as the B345 double jelly-roll fold, strongly suggests an evolutionary connection for these protein modules among phages, archaeal viruses, and eukaryotic viruses.

IPR032398	Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus, capsid protein	This entry represents the single capsid protein of infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), found particularly in shrimp densovirus. Densoviruses are a subfamily of the parvoviruses.  The capsid protein has an eight-stranded anti-parallel Î²-barrel 'jelly roll' motif similar to that found in many icosahedral viruses, including other parvoviruses. The N-terminal portion of the IHHNV coat protein adopts a 'domain-swappe' conformation relative to its twofold-related neighbour.  The loops connecting the strands of the structurally conserved jelly roll motif differ considerably in structure and length from those of other parvoviruses. IHHNV was first reported as a highly lethal disease of juvenile shrimp in 1983, and has only one type of capsid protein that lacks the phospholipase A2 activity that has been implicated as a requirement during parvoviral host cell infection. The structure of recombinant virus-like particles, composed of 60 copies of the 37.5kDa coat protein is the smallest parvoviral capsid protein reported thus far. The small size of the PstDNV capsid protein makes the system attractive as a model for studying assembly mechanisms of icosahedral virus capsids [[cite:PUB00076301]].	INTERPRO

IPR005164	Allantoicase	"Allantoicase (also known as allantoate amidinohydrolase) is involved in purine degradation, facilitating the utilization of purines as secondary nitrogen sources under nitrogen-limiting conditions. While purine degradation converges to uric acid in all vertebrates, its further degradation varies from species to species. Uric acid is excreted by birds, reptiles, and some mammals that do not have a functional uricase gene, whereas other mammals produce allantoin. Amphibians and microorganisms produce ammonia and carbon dioxide using the uricolytic pathway. Allantoicase performs the second step in this pathway catalyzing the conversion of allantoate into ureidoglycolate and urea.

&lt;reaction&gt;allantoate + H(2)0 = (S)-ureidoglycolate + urea&lt;/reaction&gt;

The structure of allantoicase is best described as being composed of two repeats (the allantoicase repeats: AR1 and AR2), which are connected by a flexible linker. The crystal structure, resolved at 2.4A resolution, reveals that AR1 has a very similar fold to AR2, both repeats being jelly-roll motifs, composed of four-stranded and five-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheets [[cite:PUB00029326]].

IPR000888	dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase-like	"Deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-hexulose 3, 5-epimerase (RmlC, [ec:5.1.3.13]) is involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-l-rhamnose, which is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall, converting dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose.

The crystal structure of RmlC from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was determined in the presence and absence of a substrate analogue. RmlC is a homodimer comprising a central jelly roll motif, which extends in two directions into longer Î²-sheets. Binding of dTDP is stabilised by ionic interactions to the phosphate group and by a combination of ionic and hydrophobic interactions with the base. The active site, which is located in the centre of the jelly roll, is formed by residues that are conserved in all known RmlC sequence homologues. The active site is lined with a number of charged residues and a number of residues with hydrogen-bonding potentials, which together comprise a potential network for substrate binding and catalysis. The active site is also lined with aromatic residues which provide favorable environments for the base moiety of dTDP and potentially for the sugar moiety of the substrate [[cite:PUB00007928]].

Also included in this family is the probable dTDP-4-oxo-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucose 3,5-epimerase from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces antibioticus&lt;/i&gt; which is required for the biosynthesis of the aglycone antibiotic oleandomycin [[cite:PUB00089648]]."	INTERPRO

PF16530	Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus, capsid	IHHNV_capsid is the single capsid protein of infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus, found particularly in shrimp densovirus.

The capsid protein has an eight-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel 'jelly roll' motif similar to that found in many icosahedral viruses, including other parvoviruses. The N-terminal portion of the IHHNV coat protein adopts a 'domain-swappe' conformation relative to its twofold-related neighbour.

IHHNV was first reported as a highly lethal disease of juvenile shrimp in 1983, and has only one type of capsid protein that lacks the phospholipase A2 activity that has been implicated as a requirement during parvoviral host cell infection. The structure of recombinant virus-like particles, composed of 60 copies of the 37.5-kDa coat protein is the smallest parvoviral capsid protein reported thus far.

IPR015908	Allantoicase domain	"Allantoicase (also known as allantoate amidinohydrolase) is involved in purine degradation, facilitating the utilization of purines as secondary nitrogen sources under nitrogen-limiting conditions. While purine degradation converges to uric acid in all vertebrates, its further degradation varies from species to species. Uric acid is excreted by birds, reptiles, and some mammals that do not have a functional uricase gene, whereas other mammals produce allantoin. Amphibians and microorganisms produce ammonia and carbon dioxide using the uricolytic pathway. Allantoicase performs the second step in this pathway catalyzing the conversion of allantoate into ureidoglycolate and urea.

&lt;reaction&gt;allantoate + H(2)0 = (S)-ureidoglycolate + urea&lt;/reaction&gt;

The structure of allantoicase is best described as being composed of two repeats (the allantoicase repeats: AR1 and AR2), which are connected by a flexible linker. The crystal structure, resolved at 2.4A resolution, reveals that AR1 has a very similar fold to AR2, both repeats being jelly-roll motifs, composed of four-stranded and five-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheets [[cite:PUB00029326]].

IPR000512	Diphtheria toxin (NAD+-dipthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase)	"Diphtheria toxin ([ec:2.4.2.36]) is a 58kDa protein secreted by lysogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The toxin causes the disease diphtheria in humans by gaining entry into the cell cytoplasm and inhibiting protein synthesis [[cite:PUB00000429]]. The mechanism of inhibition involves transfer of the ADP-ribose group of NAD to elongation factor-2 (EF-2), rendering EF-2 inactive. The catalysed reaction is as follows:

nucleophile and the general base involved in catalysis, whereas the aspartic
acid residue is important in maintaining the relative position of these
catalytic amino acids [[cite:PUB00029321]][[cite:PUB00010686]].

This is the most abundant structural protein and can account for up to 45% of virion protein [[cite:PUB00010097]]. The structure of vp54 has been determined from Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1), a very large icosahedral virus containing an internal membrane enclosed within a glycoprotein coat. The vp54 protein is a duplication consisting of two domains with a similar fold packed together like the nucleoplasmin subunits. The vp54 protein forms a trimer, where the domains are arranged around a pseudo 6-fold axis.

PF21471	Reelin subrepeat B	Reelin is an extracellular matrix serine protease that plays a role in layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. It regulates microtubule function in neurons and neuronal migration. It binds to the extracellular domains of lipoprotein receptors VLDLR and LRP8/APOER2 which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1 and modulation of TAU phosphorylation. Reelin consists of a signal sequence, an F-spondin-like region and nine sequentially concatenated repeat units. Each complete reelin repeat contains a central epidermal growth factor (EGF) module flanked by two subrepeats of 150-190 amino acids (subrepeats A and B) [1-3].

Non-enveloped animal reoviruses must enter host cells by membrane penetration that does not involve membrane fusion, as they lack a viral membrane. Reoviruses are activated by proteolytic cleavage in the intestinal lumen, leading to infectious subviral particles. The core of the virus is coated by a layer of mu1 and sigma3 proteins. Proteases strip off sigma3 exposing mu1, which provides the membrane penetration machinery that perforates the membrane. In addition, N-terminal myristoylation of polypeptide Mu1 is required for site-specific cleavage to Mu1C in transfected cells [[cite:PUB00036074]]. Mu1 forms a trimer, where the three mu1 molecules are coiled around one another with a right-handed twist.

IPR036262	Resistin-like superfamily	This superfamily consists of several mammalian resistin proteins. Resistin is a 12.5kDa cysteine-rich secreted polypeptide first reported from rodent adipocytes. It belongs to a multigene family termed RELMs or FIZZ proteins. Plasma resistin levels are significantly increased in both genetically susceptible and high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Immunoneutralisation of resistin improves hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, while administration of recombinant resistin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin action in normal mice. It has been demonstrated that increases in circulating resistin levels markedly stimulate glucose production in the presence of fixed physiological insulin levels, whereas insulin suppressed resistin expression. It has been suggested that resistin could be a link between obesity and type 2 diabetes [[cite:PUB00012942]]. The resistin structure has a disulfide-rich six-stranded Î²-sandwich fold and jelly-roll topology.	INTERPRO
IPR040697	Pullulanase, N1 domain	This is the N-terminal domain found in debranching enzymes such as Pullulanase (PulA) from Anoxybacillus sp. LM18-11. The PulA structure comprises four domains (N1, N2, A, and C). This is the N1 domain which has been identified as a carbohydrate-binding motif. Two maltotriose or maltotetraose molecules were found between the N1 domain and a loop of the A domain in the PulA-maltotriose or PulA-maltotetraose structures. These carbohydrates are bound in a parallel binding mode close to each other and form hydrogen bonds.  The sugar moieties bound to the N1 domain are not immediately adjacent to the active site, but the enzyme might use N1 binding to attract and grab the substrate. Functional analysis indicate that N1 is important for catalytic activity and thermostability in addition to assisting substrate binding. The structure of the N1 domain reveals a classic distorted Î²-jelly roll fold consisting of two anti-parallel Î²-sheets, forming a concave and a convex surface. On the concave side of N1 domain there is a cleft to accommodate two molecules of maltotriose or maltotetraose [[cite:PUB00091225]].	INTERPRO

It is active against a wide range of bacteria and some fungi. The antimicrobial activity of bacilysin is antagonized by glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine, indicating that bacilysin interferes with glucosamine synthesis, and thus, with the synthesis of microbial cell walls.  AerE is thought to be involved in the formation of the 2-carboxy-6-hydroxyoctahydroindole (Choi) moiety found on all aeruginosin tetrapeptides, based on gene knock-out experiments.

DddK cleaves dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the organic osmolyte and antioxidant produced in marine environments, and yields acrylate and the climate-active gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS). DddK contains a double-stranded beta-helical motif which utilizes various divalent metal ions as cofactors for catalytic activity; however, nickel, an abundant metal ion in marine environments, confers the highest DMSP lyase activity. Also included in this family is Plu4264, a Photorhabdus luminescens manganese-containing cupin shown to have similar metal binding site to TM1287 decarboxylase, but two very different substrate binding pockets. The Plu4264 binding pocket shows a cavity and substrate entry point more than twice as large as and more hydrophobic than TM1287, suggesting that Plu4264 accepts a substrate that is significantly larger than that of TM1287, a putative oxalate decarboxylase.

CENP-C localizes to the inner kinetochore plates adjacent to the centromeric DNA and is known to have DNA-binding ability. CENP-C, along with CENP-H, provides a platform onto which the mitotic kinetochore is assembled and thus plays a critical role in the structuring of kinethocore chromatin.

Structurally, the C-JID core is represented by a beta-sandwich made up of 8 to 9 beta-strands. C-JID matches the so-called post-LRR or C-terminal non-LRR domain detected earlier via MEME and BLAST searches [[cite:PUB00098644],[cite:PUB00100184]]. The domain showed a strong distribution bias towards TIR-NLRs of dicotyledonous plant species despite broader taxonomic distribution of TIR-NLR in plant groups [1-7]. Structure-function analyses of cryoEM structures suggest that C-JID domains play a role in substrate recognition, such as binding to effector proteins from pathogens, and thus are involved in the initiation of signaling by TIR-NLR receptors [[cite:PUB00098643],[cite:PUB00098642]]. Presence of C-JID (or post-LRR) and its importance for the function of Arabidopsis TIR-NLR RPS4 that partners with RRS1 for effector recognition suggest that C-JID has additional functions [4-6].

The crystal structure of the Trp RNA-binding attenuation protein of Bacillus subtilis (mtrB, [swissprot:P19466]) has been solved [[cite:PUB00004208]]. TRAP forms an oligomeric ring consisting of 11 single-domain subunits, where each subunit adopts a double-stranded Î²-helix structure with the appearance of a Î²-sandwich of distinct architecture and jelly-roll fold. The 11 subunits are stabilised by 11 inter-subunit strands, forming a Î²-wheel with a large central hole. TRAP is activated by binding to tryptophan in clefts between adjacent Î²-strands, which induces conformational changes in the protein. Activated TRAP binds an mRNA target sequence consisting of 11 (G/U)AG repeats, separated by 2-3 spacer nucleotides. The spacer nucleotides do not make direct contact with the TRAP protein, but they do influence the conformation of the RNA, which might influence the specificity of TRAP [[cite:PUB00022801]].

L-Rhamnose (6-deoxy-l-mannose) plays an important role in the cell-wall structure of many bacterial species. It has been found to contribute to the virulence of several species, including the Gram-negative Salmonella enterica and Vibrio cholerae, where it is present as a part of the O-antigen, and is essential for the growth of Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes.

Nickel-dependent ureases are found in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants. Their primary role is to allow the use of external and internally-generated urea as a nitrogen source. The enzyme consists of three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which can exist as separate proteins or can be fused on a single protein chain. The Î±-Î²-Î³ heterotrimer forms multimers, mainly trimers. The large alpha subunit is the catalytic domain containing an active site with a bi-nickel centre complexed by a carbamylated lysine.

IPR002884	P domain	"In eukaryotes, many essential secreted proteins and peptide hormones are excised from larger precursors by members of a class of calcium-dependent endoproteinases, the prohormone-proprotein convertases (PCs).The P (known as such because it is essential for proteolytic activity), or Homo B, domain of ~150 residues is a distinctive characteristic of members of the proprotein convertase family. The P/Homo B domain appears to be necessary to both fold and maintain the subtilisin-like active catalytic module and to regulate its specialized features of calcium and more acidic pH dependence [[cite:PUB00087110], [cite:PUB00003014], [cite:PUB00029766], [cite:PUB00053054]].

The core of the P/Homo B domain consists of a jelly roll-like fold with eight Î²-strands.

PF03367	ZPR1 zinc-finger domain	This entry represents the zinc-ribbon domain found in ZPR1 family. The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It is indeed known to be an essential protein in yeast. In quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens, ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00020594],[cite:PUB00020595],[cite:PUB00017397]]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes [[cite:PUB00020594]]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation [[cite:PUB00020594]], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression [[cite:PUB00020595]]. ZPR1 binds preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00045181]]. The alignment for the ZPR1 family shows a duplicated set composed of a zinc-ribbon domain (this entry) followed by a jelly-roll domain.

HppE uses a facial triad with two histidine ligands and one aspartic acid or glutamic acid, His2(Glu/Asp), to catalyze a variety of different reactions, including DNA repair and antibiotic biosynthesis. The C-terminal catalytic domain of HppE has a cupin fold that binds a divalent cation, whereas the N-terminal domain carries a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif with putative DNA-binding helices. HppE converts (S)-2-hydroxypropyl-1-phosphonate (S-HPP) to the antibiotic fosfomycin [(1R,2S)-epoxypropylphosphonate] in an unusual 1,3-dehydrogenation of a secondary alcohol to an epoxide; it uses H2O2 as a co-substrate to abstract hydrogen (Ho) from C1 of S-HPP to initiate epoxide ring closure, using an iron(IV)-oxo complex as the Ho abstractor.

The 11 subunits are stabilised by 11 inter-subunit strands, forming a Î²-wheel with a large central hole. TRAP is activated by binding to tryptophan in clefts between adjacent Î²-strands, which induces conformational changes in the protein.

IPR000386	Haemagglutinin, influenzavirus B	"Haemagglutinin (HA) is one of two main surface fusion glycoproteins embedded in the envelope of influenza viruses, the other being neuraminidase (NA). There are sixteen known HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9), which together are used to classify influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). The antigenic variations in HA and NA enable the virus to evade host antibodies made to previous influenza strains, accounting for recurrent influenza epidemics [[cite:PUB00033165]]. The HA glycoprotein is present in the viral membrane as a single polypeptide (HA0), which must be cleaved by the host's trypsin-like proteases to produce two peptides (HA1 and HA2) in order for the virus to be infectious. Once HA0 is cleaved, the newly exposed N-terminal of the HA2 peptide then acts to fuse the viral envelope to the cellular membrane of the host cell, which allows the viral negative-stranded RNA to infect the host cell. The type of host protease can influence the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.

The haemagglutinin glycoprotein is a trimer containing three structurally distinct regions: a globular head consisting of anti-parallel Î²-sheets that form a Î²-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold (contains the receptor binding site and the HA1/HA2 cleavage site); a triple-stranded, coiled-coil, Î±-helical stalk; and a globular foot composed of anti-parallel Î²-sheets [[cite:PUB00033162], [cite:PUB00033164]]. Each monomer consists of an intact HA0 polypeptide with the HA1 and HA2 regions linked by disulphide bonds. The N terminus of HA1 provides the central strand in the 5-stranded globular foot, while the rest of the HA1 chain makes its way to the 8-stranded globular head.  HA2 provides two Î± helices, which form part of the triple-stranded coiled-coil that stabilises the trimer, its C terminus providing the remaining strands of the 5-stranded globular foot.

three adjacent protruding loops that play a key role in lipid binding. The

PS01285	Coagulation factors 5/8 type C domain (FA58C) signature 1	"Blood coagulation factors V and VIII contain a C-terminal, twice repeated,
domain of about 150 amino acids, which is called F5/8 type C, FA58C, or C1/C2-
like domain. A distant sequence similarity has been noted between the C1 /C2
domains of Factors V and VIII and the discoidin proteins, which comprise a
family of phospholipid-binding lectins and other proteins involved in adhesive
interactions [[cite:PUB00005054]].

In coagulation factors V and VIII the repeated domains compose part of a
larger functional domain which promotes binding to anionic phospholipids on
the surface of platelets and endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00000770]]. The C-terminal domain of
the second FA58C repeat (C2) of coagulation factor VIII has been shown to be
responsible for phosphatidylserine-binding and essential for activity [[cite:PUB00000771]][[cite:PUB00002850]].

The crystal structure of the FA58C domain has been solved [5]. It exhibits a distorted jelly-roll beta-barrel motif, consisting
of eight antiparallel strands arranged in two beta-sheets. The lower part of
the beta-barrel is characterized by a preponderance of basic residues and
three adjacent protruding loops that play a key role in lipid binding. The
galactose binding domain of fungal galactose oxidase exhibits structural
similarity to FA58C. The three adjacent loops are conserved and localized in a
region which has been predicted to anchor the enzyme to plant cell walls. This
may indicate a common binding role for the loop region.

Similar domains have been detected in other extracellular and membrane
proteins [[cite:PUB00004623]][[cite:PUB00004819]][[cite:PUB00001120]] which are listed below:

PS51762	Glycosyl hydrolases family 16 (GH16) domain profile	"The glycosyl hydrolases family 16 (GH16) [[cite:PUB00000503]] contains functionally
heterogeneous members, including beta-agarases, endo-1,3-beta-glucanases
(laminarinases), endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases (lichenases), kappa-
carrageenases, endo-beta-galactosidases and xyloglucan endotransferases. These
enzymes share a common ancestor and have diverged significantly in their
primary sequence.

The GH16 catalytic domain has a classical sandwich-like beta-jelly roll fold,
formed by two main, closely packed and curved antiparallel beta sheets,
creating a deep channel harboring the catalytic machinery.
Even though the GH16 domains have now diverged significantly in their primary
sequences, they all feature a common catalytic motif, E-[ILV]-D-[IVAF]-
[VILMF](0,1)-E. The two glutamic acid residues in the conserved motif are the
nucleophile and the general base involved in catalysis, whereas the aspartic
acid residue is important in maintaining the relative position of these
catalytic amino acids [[cite:PUB00029321]][[cite:PUB00010686]].

Some proteins known to contain a GH16 domain are listed below:

IPR036801	Diphtheria toxin, translocation domain superfamily	"Diphtheria toxin ([ec:2.4.2.36]) is a 58kDa protein secreted by lysogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The toxin causes the disease diphtheria in humans by gaining entry into the cell cytoplasm and inhibiting protein synthesis [[cite:PUB00000429]]. The mechanism of inhibition involves transfer of the ADP-ribose group of NAD to elongation factor-2 (EF-2), rendering EF-2 inactive. The catalysed reaction is as follows:


&lt;reaction&gt;
NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + peptide diphthamide = nicotinamide + peptide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)diphthamide
&lt;/reaction&gt;


The crystal structure of the diphtheria toxin homodimer has been determined to 2.5A resolution [[cite:PUB00004122]]. The structure reveals a Y-shaped molecule of 3 domains, a catalytic domain (fragment A), whose fold is of the Î±+Î² type; a transmembrane (TM) domain, which consists of 9 Î±-helices, 2 pairs of which may participate in pH-triggered membrane insertion and translocation; and a receptor-binding domain, which forms a flattened Î²-barrel with a jelly-roll-like topology [[cite:PUB00004122]]. The TM- and receptor binding-domains together constitute fragment B. This entry represents the translocation domain (also known as the T domain) found in the middle of the Diphtheria toxin protein. The T domain has a multi-helical globin-like fold with two additional helices at N-termini, but which has no counterpart to the first globin helix. This domain is thought to unfold in the membrane [[cite:PUB00036573]]. pH-induced conformational change in the T domain triggers insertion into the endosomal membrane and facilitates the transfer of the catalytic domain into the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00005016], [cite:PUB00000429]]."

IPR001364	Haemagglutinin, influenzavirus A/B	"Haemagglutinin (HA) is one of two main surface fusion glycoproteins embedded in the envelope of influenza viruses, the other being neuraminidase (NA). There are sixteen known HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9), which together are used to classify influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). The antigenic variations in HA and NA enable the virus to evade host antibodies made to previous influenza strains, accounting for recurrent influenza epidemics [[cite:PUB00033165]]. The HA glycoprotein is present in the viral membrane as a single polypeptide (HA0), which must be cleaved by the host's trypsin-like proteases to produce two peptides (HA1 and HA2) in order for the virus to be infectious. Once HA0 is cleaved, the newly exposed N-terminal of the HA2 peptide then acts to fuse the viral envelope to the cellular membrane of the host cell, which allows the viral negative-stranded RNA to infect the host cell. The type of host protease can influence the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.

The haemagglutinin glycoprotein is a trimer containing three structurally distinct regions: a globular head consisting of anti-parallel Î²-sheets that form a Î²-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold (contains the receptor binding site and the HA1/HA2 cleavage site); a triple-stranded, coiled-coil, Î±-helical stalk; and a globular foot composed of anti-parallel Î²-sheets [[cite:PUB00033162], [cite:PUB00033164]]. Each monomer consists of an intact HA0 polypeptide with the HA1 and HA2 regions linked by disulphide bonds. The N terminus of HA1 provides the central strand in the 5-stranded globular foot, while the rest of the HA1 chain makes its way to the 8-stranded globular head.  HA2 provides two Î± helices, which form part of the triple-stranded coiled-coil that stabilises the trimer, its C terminus providing the remaining strands of the 5-stranded globular foot.

IPR001956	Carbohydrate-binding module 3	"Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) have been classified into more than 40 families according to sequence homology. Several cellulolytic enzymes share a conserved region of about 150 amino acid residues, the CBM3 domain [[cite:PUB00001730]]. It has been classified in three different subtypes, termed family IIIa, IIIb and IIIc. The family IIIa (scaffoldin) and IIIb (mainly free enzymes) are closely similar in their primary structures and both types bind strongly to crystalline cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296], [cite:PUB00025133]]. Members of the family IIIc, fail to bind crystalline cellulose, but serve in a 'helper' capacity by feeding a single incoming cellulose chain into the active site of the neighbouring catalytic module pending hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00033741], [cite:PUB00033742]].

The CBM3 domain is mainly found C-terminal to the catalytic domain, which correspond to a wide range of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases like family 9, family 5 and family 10.

The crystal structure of CBM3 has been solved [[cite:PUB00001296]]. It consists of nine Î²-strands which form a compact domain that has an overall prismatic shape. It is arranged in two antiparallel Î²-sheets that stack face-to-face to form a Î² sandwich with jelly roll topology. Two defined surfaces, located on opposite sides of the molecule, contain conserved polar and aromatic residues which are probably involved in the binding of the CBM to cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296], [cite:PUB00025133]]. The first one forms a planar strip whereas the second one forms a shallow groove.

IPR005086	Carbohydrate binding module family 17/28	"A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) is defined as a contiguous amino acid sequence within a carbohydrate-active enzyme with a discreet fold having carbohydrate-binding activity. A few exceptions are CBMs in cellulosomal scaffolding proteins and rare instances of independent putative CBMs. The requirement of CBMs existing as modules within larger enzymes sets this class of carbohydrate-binding protein apart from other non-catalytic sugar binding proteins such as lectins and sugar transport proteins.



CBMs were previously classified as cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) based on the initial discovery of several modules that bound cellulose [[cite:PUB00054922], [cite:PUB00054923]]. However, additional modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes are continually being found that bind carbohydrates other than cellulose yet otherwise meet the CBM criteria, hence the need to reclassify these polypeptides using more inclusive terminology.



Previous classification of cellulose-binding domains were based on amino acid similarity. Groupings of CBDs were called ""Types"" and numbered with roman numerals (e.g. Type I or Type II CBDs). In keeping with the glycoside hydrolase classification, these groupings are now called families and numbered with Arabic numerals. Families 1 to 13 are the same as Types I to XIII. For a detailed review on the structure and binding modes of CBMs see [[cite:PUB00054924]]. [cazy:CBM17] binds to amorphous cellulose and soluble beta-1,4-glucans, with a minimal binding requirement of cellotriose and optimal affinity for cellohexaose. Family 17 CBMs appear to have a very shallow binding cleft that may be more accessible to cellulose chains in non-crystalline cellulose than the deeper binding clefts of family 4 CBMs [[cite:PUB00026290]]. [cazy:CBM28] does not compete with CBM17 modules when binding to non-crystalline cellulose but does have a ""Î²-jelly roll"" topology, which is similar in structure to the CBM17 domains. Sequence and structural conservation in families 17 and 28 suggests that they have evolved through gene duplication and subsequent divergence [[cite:PUB00037901]].

right hand. Several anti-parallel beta-strands bend almost
90ï¿½ to produce a substrate-binding groove characteristic of the GH11 domain

of the groove. The hydrolysis reaction is believed to follow a double-
displacement mechanism, with one Glu residue acting as a general acid/base
catalyst and the other as a nucleophile.

Two of the conserved regions in these enzymes are centered on glutamic acid

CBM6 bind to amorphous cellulose, xylan, mixed beta-(1,3)(1,4)glucan and beta-1,3-glucan [[cite:PUB00032219], [cite:PUB00033743], [cite:PUB00031940]].

CBM6 adopts a classic lectin-like Î²-jelly roll fold, predominantly consisting of five antiparallel Î²-strands on one face and four antiparallel Î²-strands on the other face. It contains two potential ligand binding sites, named respectively cleft A and B. These clefts include aromatic residues which are probably involved in the substrate binding. The cleft B is located on the concave surface of one Î²-sheet, and the cleft A on one edge of the protein between the loop that connects the inner and outer Î²-sheets of the jellyroll fold [[cite:PUB00033744]]. The multiple binding clefts confer the extensive range of specificities displayed by the domain [[cite:PUB00032219], [cite:PUB00033743], [cite:PUB00031940]]. A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) is defined as a contiguous amino acid sequence within a carbohydrate-active enzyme with a discreet fold having carbohydrate-binding activity. A few exceptions are CBMs in cellulosomal scaffolding proteins and rare instances of independent putative CBMs. The requirement of CBMs existing as modules within larger enzymes sets this class of carbohydrate-binding protein apart from other non-catalytic sugar binding proteins such as lectins and sugar transport proteins.



CBMs were previously classified as cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) based on the initial discovery of several modules that bound cellulose [[cite:PUB00054922], [cite:PUB00054923]]. However, additional modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes are continually being found that bind carbohydrates other than cellulose yet otherwise meet the CBM criteria, hence the need to reclassify these polypeptides using more inclusive terminology.



Previous classification of cellulose-binding domains were based on amino acid similarity. Groupings of CBDs were called ""Types"" and numbered with roman numerals (e.g. Type I or Type II CBDs). In keeping with the glycoside hydrolase classification, these groupings are now called families and numbered with Arabic numerals. Families 1 to 13 are the same as Types I to XIII. For a detailed review on the structure and binding modes of CBMs see [[cite:PUB00054924]]."	INTERPRO
PS51829	P/Homo B domain profile	"In eukaryotes, many essential secreted proteins and peptide hormones are
excised from larger precursors by members of a class of calcium-dependent
endoproteinases, the prohormone-proprotein convertases (PCs).The P (known as
such because it is essential for proteolytic activity), or Homo B, domain of
~150 residues is a distinctive characteristic of members of the proprotein
convertase family. The P/Homo B domain appears to be necessary to both fold
and maintain the subtilisin-like active catalytic module and to regulate its
specialized features of calcium and more acidic pH dependence [[cite:PUB00087110]][[cite:PUB00003014]][[cite:PUB00029766]][[cite:PUB00053054]].

The core of the P/Homo B domain consists of a jelly roll-like fold with eight
beta-strands. Nonbonded interactions between the catalytic
and P/Homo B domains provide additional structural stabilization of the
catalytic domains, which alone appear to be thermodynamically unstable [[cite:PUB00029766]][[cite:PUB00053054]].

Some proteins known to contain a P/Homo B domain are listed below:

 - Fungal  kexin-like protein, a component of the subtilase family involved in
   the processing of proproteins to their active forms.
 - Mammalian  furin (also called SPC1/PACE; EC 3.4.21.75), likely to represent
   the ubiquitous endoprotease activity within constitutive secretory pathways
   and capable of cleavage at the RX(K/R)R consensus motif.
 - Mammalian  neuroendocrine  convertase  1 and 2 (NEC1 and NEC2), involved in
   the processing  of  hormone and other protein precursors at sites comprised
   of pairs of basic amino acid residues.
 - Mammalina  PACE4,  likely  to represent an endoprotease activity within the
   constitutive secretory pathway, with unique restricted distribution in both
   neuroendocrine and  non-neuroendocrine  tissues  and capable of cleavage at
   the RX(K/R)R consensus motif.
 - Mammalian  PC4, proprotein convertase involved in the processing of hormone
   and other  protein  precursors  at  sites comprised of pairs of basic amino
   acid residues.
 - Mammalian  PC5/PC6,  plays  an essential role in pregnancy establishment by
   proteolytic activation of a number of important factors such as BMP2, CALD1
   and alpha-integrins.
 - Mammalian  PC7/PC8/LPC/SPC7,  likely to represent a ubiquitous endoprotease
   activity within  constitutive secretory pathways and capable of cleavage at
   the RXXX[KR]R consensus motif.
 - Aeromonas salmonicida microbial serine proteinase (EC:3.4.21.-) (AspA).

The profile we developed covers the entire P/Homo B domain."	PROFILE
IPR036966	Carbohydrate-binding module 3 superfamily	"Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) have been classified into more than 40 families according to sequence homology. Several cellulolytic enzymes share a conserved region of about 150 amino acid residues, the CBM3 domain [[cite:PUB00001730]]. It has been classified in three different subtypes, termed family IIIa, IIIb and IIIc. The family IIIa (scaffoldin) and IIIb (mainly free enzymes) are closely similar in their primary structures and both types bind strongly to crystalline cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296], [cite:PUB00025133]]. Members of the family IIIc, fail to bind crystalline cellulose, but serve in a 'helper' capacity by feeding a single incoming cellulose chain into the active site of the neighbouring catalytic module pending hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00033741], [cite:PUB00033742]].

The CBM3 domain is mainly found C-terminal to the catalytic domain, which correspond to a wide range of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases like family 9, family 5 and family 10.

The crystal structure of CBM3 has been solved [[cite:PUB00001296]]. It consists of nine Î²-strands which form a compact domain that has an overall prismatic shape. It is arranged in two antiparallel Î²-sheets that stack face-to-face to form a Î² sandwich with jelly roll topology. Two defined surfaces, located on opposite sides of the molecule, contain conserved polar and aromatic residues which are probably involved in the binding of the CBM to cellulose [[cite:PUB00001296], [cite:PUB00025133]]. The first one forms a planar strip whereas the second one forms a shallow groove.

Some proteins known to contain a CBM3 domain are listed below:



Clostridial cellulosomal scaffolding proteins cipA, cipC and cbpA. They promote the binding of cellulose to the catalytic domains of the cellulolytic enzymes.
Bacterial cellulases A, B, F, G, I, N, Y, Z (Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, [ec:3.2.1.4]).


This entry represents the CBM3 domain, which is also known as cellulose-binding domain family III (CBD III)."	INTERPRO
IPR013828	Haemagglutinin, HA1 chain, alpha/beta domain superfamily	"Haemagglutinin (HA) is one of two main surface fusion glycoproteins embedded in the envelope of influenza viruses, the other being neuraminidase (NA). There are sixteen known HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9), which together are used to classify influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). The antigenic variations in HA and NA enable the virus to evade host antibodies made to previous influenza strains, accounting for recurrent influenza epidemics [[cite:PUB00033165]]. The HA glycoprotein is present in the viral membrane as a single polypeptide (HA0), which must be cleaved by the host's trypsin-like proteases to produce two peptides (HA1 and HA2) in order for the virus to be infectious. Once HA0 is cleaved, the newly exposed N-terminal of the HA2 peptide then acts to fuse the viral envelope to the cellular membrane of the host cell, which allows the viral negative-stranded RNA to infect the host cell. The type of host protease can influence the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.

The haemagglutinin glycoprotein is a trimer containing three structurally distinct regions: a globular head consisting of anti-parallel Î²-sheets that form a Î²-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold (contains the receptor binding site and the HA1/HA2 cleavage site); a triple-stranded, coiled-coil, Î±-helical stalk; and a globular foot composed of anti-parallel Î²-sheets [[cite:PUB00033162], [cite:PUB00033164]]. Each monomer consists of an intact HA0 polypeptide with the HA1 and HA2 regions linked by disulphide bonds. The N terminus of HA1 provides the central strand in the 5-stranded globular foot, while the rest of the HA1 chain makes its way to the 8-stranded globular head.  HA2 provides two Î± helices, which form part of the triple-stranded coiled-coil that stabilises the trimer, its C terminus providing the remaining strands of the 5-stranded globular foot. This superfamily represents a subdomain of the HA1 peptide that occurs following HA0 cleavage. This subdomain has an Î±/Î² structure."	INTERPRO
IPR000859	CUB domain	"The CUB domain (for complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) is a structural motif of approximately 110 residues found almost exclusively in extracellular and plasma membrane-associated proteins, many of which are developmentally regulated [[cite:PUB00003306], [cite:PUB00001610]]. These proteins are involved in a diverse range of functions, including complement activation, developmental patterning, tissue repair, axon guidance and angiogenesis, cell signalling, fertilisation, haemostasis, inflammation, neurotransmission, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and tumour suppression [[cite:PUB00035660]]. Many CUB-containing proteins are peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase families M12A (astacin) and S1A (chymotrypsin). Proteins containing a CUB domain include:



Mammalian complement subcomponents C1s/C1r, which form the calcium-dependent complex C1, the first component of the classical pathway of the complement system.

Cricetidae sp. (Hamster) serine protease Casp, which degrades type I and IV collagen and fibronectin in the presence of calcium.

Mammalian complement-activating component of Ra-reactive factor (RARF), a protease that cleaves the C4 component of complement.

Vertebrate enteropeptidase ([ec:3.4.21.9]), a type II membrane protein of the intestinal brush border, which activates trypsinogen.

Mammalian hyaluronate-binding protein TSG-6 (or PS4), a serum and growth factor induced protein.

Mammalian spermadhesins.

Xenopus laevis embryonic protein UVS.2, which is expressed during dorsoanterior development.



Several of the above proteins consist of a catalytic domain together with several CUB domains interspersed by calcium-binding EGF domains. Some CUB domains appear to be involved in oligomerisation and/or recognition of substrates and binding partners. For example, in the complement proteases, the CUB domains mediate dimerisation and binding to collagen-like regions of target proteins (e.g. C1q for C1r/C1s). The structure of CUB domains consists of a Î²-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold. Almost all CUB domains contain four conserved cysteines that probably form two disulphide bridges (C1-C2, C3-C4). The CUB1 domains of C1s and Map19 have calcium-binding sites [[cite:PUB00035659]]."	INTERPRO
PS50871	C1q domain profile	"C1q is a subunit of the C1 enzyme complex that activates the serum complement
system. It is composed of 9 disulfide-linked dimers of the chains A, B and C,
which share a common structure which consist of a N-terminal nonhelical
region, a triple helical (collagenous) region and a C-terminal globular head
which is called the C1q domain. That domain consists of about 136 amino acids
and has been found in the C-terminus of vertebrate secreted or membrane-bound
proteins which are mostly short-chain collagens and collagen-like molecules
[[cite:PUB00000533]][[cite:PUB00001637]][[cite:PUB00001428]]. These proteins are listed below:

 - Complement  C1q subcomponent  chains A, B and C. Efficient activation of C1
   takes place on interaction of the globular heads of C1q with the Fc regions
   of IgG or IgM antibody present in immune complexes.
 - Vertebrate short-chain  collagen  type  VIII,  the major  component  of the
   basement membrane  of corneal endothelial cells. It is composed of a triple
   helical domain  in  between  a  short  N-terminal and  a  larger C-terminal
   globule which contains the C1q domain.
 - Vertebrate collagen type X, which has the same structure than collagen type
   VIII. It is a product of hyperthrophic chondrotocytes.
 - Bluegill  inner-ear  specific structural protein. This short-chain collagen
   forms a microstructural matrix within the otolithic membrane.
 - Chipmunk hibernation-associated plasma  proteins  HP-20,  HP-25  and HP-27.
   These proteins disappear from blood  specifically during  hibernation. They
   contain a collagen-like  domain  near  the  N-terminus and a C-terminal C1q
   domain.
 - Human  precerebellin, which  is  located  within postsynaptic structures of
   Purkinje cells, probably membrane-bound. Cerebellin is involved in synaptic
   activity.
 - Rat precerebellin-like  glycoprotein, a probable membrane protein.  The C1q
   domain is located at the C-terminal extracellular extremity.
 - Human  endothelial  cell  multimerin  (ECM), a carrier protein for platelet
   factor V/VA.
 - Vertebrate  30 Kd adipocyte complement-related protein (ACRP30), also known
   as ApM1 or AdipoQ.
 - Vertebrate  myonectin  (CTRP15),  a nutrient responsive myokine secreted by
   skeletal muscle to regulate whole-body fatty acid metabolism [[cite:PUB00109627]].

The C-terminal globular domain of the C1q subcomponents and collagen types
VIII and X is important both for the correct folding and alignment of the
triple helix and for protein-protein recognition events [[cite:PUB00000094]]. For collagen
type X it has been suggested that the domain is important for initiation and
maintenance of the correct assembly of the protein [[cite:PUB00003070]]. The globular head is a
trimer of C1q domains. Each individual C1q adopts a 10-strand Jelly-roll fold
arranged in two antiparallel 5-stranded beta-sheets [[cite:PUB00075555]].
There are two well conserved regions within the C1q domain: an aromatic motif
is located within the first half of the domain, the other conserved region is
located near the C-terminal extremity."	PROFILE

PS50022	Coagulation factors 5/8 type C domain (FA58C) profile	"Blood coagulation factors V and VIII contain a C-terminal, twice repeated,
domain of about 150 amino acids, which is called F5/8 type C, FA58C, or C1/C2-
like domain. A distant sequence similarity has been noted between the C1 /C2
domains of Factors V and VIII and the discoidin proteins, which comprise a
family of phospholipid-binding lectins and other proteins involved in adhesive
interactions [[cite:PUB00005054]].

In coagulation factors V and VIII the repeated domains compose part of a
larger functional domain which promotes binding to anionic phospholipids on
the surface of platelets and endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00000770]]. The C-terminal domain of
the second FA58C repeat (C2) of coagulation factor VIII has been shown to be
responsible for phosphatidylserine-binding and essential for activity [[cite:PUB00000771]][[cite:PUB00002850]].

The crystal structure of the FA58C domain has been solved [5]. It exhibits a distorted jelly-roll beta-barrel motif, consisting
of eight antiparallel strands arranged in two beta-sheets. The lower part of
the beta-barrel is characterized by a preponderance of basic residues and
three adjacent protruding loops that play a key role in lipid binding. The
galactose binding domain of fungal galactose oxidase exhibits structural
similarity to FA58C. The three adjacent loops are conserved and localized in a
region which has been predicted to anchor the enzyme to plant cell walls. This
may indicate a common binding role for the loop region.

Similar domains have been detected in other extracellular and membrane
proteins [[cite:PUB00004623]][[cite:PUB00004819]][[cite:PUB00001120]] which are listed below:

 - Mammalian  milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGM), which is expressed in milk
   and sperm.  It  is probably involved in phospholipid-binding. It contains 2
   EGF-like repeats followed by 2 copies of FA58C.
 - Neuropilin  (A5 antigen), a calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule that
   function during  the  formation  of certain neuronal circuits. The sequence
   contains 2   CUB domains.
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed of 2 FA58C domains, a C-type lectin domain, 2 VWFC domains and a CTCK.
 - Human  AEBP1,  a  transcriptional repressor  with carboxypeptidase activity
   that is  probably  involved  in  the  regulation  of the differentiation of
   osteoblasts. AEBP1  contains a single copy of FA58C. Mouse AEBP1 is shorter
   in its N-terminal and lacks part of the FA58C domain.
 - Bovine  Sco-spondin,  which  is  secreted  by  the  subcommissural organ in
   embryos and  is  involved  in  the  modulation  of neuronal aggregation. It
   contains at least 2 EGF-like domains, one FA58C, and 3 LDLRA domains.
 - Drosophila  neurexin  IV  which is required for septate junction and blood-
   nerve barrier  formation  and function. In comparision to neurexins I-alpha
   and III-alpha, which are composed of 6 LamG domains and 3 EGF-like repeats,
   the N-terminal LamG has been substituted by a FA58C domain in neurexin IV.
 - Mammalian  contactin  associated  proteins (CASPR), which are implicated in
   protein-protein interactions.
 - Mammalian  tyrosine-protein  kinase  receptors EDDR1 (CAK, DDR1, TRKE, etc)
   and NTRK3 (TKT or TYRO10) which all contain one copy of the FA58C domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  putative tyrosine-protein kinases G01D9.2, F11D5.3
   and C25F6.4.

FA58C contains two conserved cysteines in most proteins, which link the
extremities of the domain by a disulfide bond [[cite:PUB00000383]]. A further disulfide
bond is located near the C-terminal of the second FA58C domain in MFGM [11].
